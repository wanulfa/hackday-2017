# Shared Data Unit hackday, 2017

This is a repo (folder) for the Shared Data Unit hackday on December 4 2017:

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and are signed in.
2. Fork this repo by clicking the 'fork' button in the upper right corner
3. This will take you to your own copy of the repo. 
4. Now create a new folder in that repo by clicking on **Create new file** and then typing a folder name followed by `readme.md`, e.g. if your team is called 'crime', create a new file called `crime/readme.md` - this will create both the folder and the read me file within it.
5. Use that folder to store the data and other elements as you work throughout the day. Edit the `readme.md` file to describe what you're doing!
6. At the end of the day you can submit a *pull request* to have your folder pulled back into the main repo here. 

If you need any help ask Paul Bradshaw!

## Possible projects

It's up to you what you make by the end of the hackday, but here are some ideas:

* A data visualisation (chart, map, network diagram, etc.)
* An infographic (this might combine datavis with key facts, images etc)
* A story pitch/top line (you probably won't have time to write the whole story!)
* A backgrounder/briefing
* A tool (e.g. calculator, search, interactive visualisation, quiz, game)
* A bot

## Possible datasets

Feel free to use any of the datasets on the [BBC Data Unit GitHub account](https://github.com/bbc-data-unit). You can click on any tag to see all repos around that topic. For example, repos with data related to housing would be at [https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahousing+org%3ABBC-Data-Unit&type=Repositories](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahousing+org%3ABBC-Data-Unit&type=Repositories)
